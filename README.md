# Talking-Calculator-using-Python
This calculator speaks the welcome message for the user and also tells him the output generated through speaking.


It's in development process for now, it speaks only welcome message and not the output calculated, there are some minor error for that, although I've added the code for it but commented them. 
So, if possible try to resolve it and let me know or I'll anyways resolve that when I get time for it.
